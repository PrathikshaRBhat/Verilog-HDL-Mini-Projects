A Clock divider is a circuit which is responsible for generating output signals with reduced frequencies from an input clock sources.
A clock divider, also known as a frequency divider, takes an input signal and generates an output signal with a different frequency. 
The output frequency is calculated as fout = fin / n, where n is an integer.

The primary objective of a clock divider is to control the timing of various operations which operate at different speeds. When, diverse sections of circuit require distinct clock frequencies,clock divider is used to different clock pulses, instead of using separate clock for easy circuit. Hence it optimizes power consumption and increase performance.
