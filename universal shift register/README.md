What is a shift register?
A shift register is a type of digital circuit that can store and shift data in a sequential manner. It is a cascade of flip-flops, where the output of one flip-flop is connected to the input of the next flip-flop. The data is shifted from one flip-flop to the next on every clock cycle, allowing the circuit to delay or store the data. Please find below the Verilog code of a shift register:

What is Universal shift register?
A universal shift register is a sequential logic that can store data within and on every clock pulse it transfers data to the output port.

The universal shift register can be used as

1. Parallel In Parallel Out shift register
2. Parallel In Serial Out shift register
3. Serial In Parallel Out shift register
4. Serial In Serial Out shift register
