A magnitude digital Comparator is a combinational circuit that compares two digital or binary numbers in order to find out whether one binary number is equal, less than, or greater than the other binary number. We logically design a circuit for which we will have two inputs one for A and the other for B and have three output terminals, one for A > B condition, one for A = B condition, and one for A < B condition. 

The circuit works by comparing the bits of the two numbers starting from the most significant bit (MSB) and moving toward the least significant bit (LSB). At each bit position, the two corresponding bits of the numbers are compared. If the bit in the first number is greater than the corresponding bit in the second number, the A>B output is set to 1, and the circuit immediately determines that the first number is greater than the second. Similarly, if the bit in the second number is greater than the corresponding bit in the first number, the A<B output is set to 1, and the circuit immediately determines that the first number is less than the second.

If the two corresponding bits are equal, the circuit moves to the next bit position and compares the next pair of bits. This process continues until all the bits have been compared. If at any point in the comparison, the circuit determines that the first number is greater or less than the second number, the comparison is terminated, and the appropriate output is generated.

If all the bits are equal, the circuit generates an A=B output, indicating that the two numbers are equal.
